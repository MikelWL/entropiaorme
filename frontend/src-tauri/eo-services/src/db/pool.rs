//! The synchronous connection core behind [`Db`](super::Db): one writer
//! thread owning the write connection, and a small pool of reader
//! threads each owning a read connection against the WAL.
//!
//! The topology re-expresses the seam's established doctrine (one
//! dedicated writer serialising every mutation; concurrent readers so a
//! live write stream never stalls dashboard reads) in synchronous
//! terms: exclusive access to a connection IS the thread that owns it,
//! so there is no pool checkout, no lock order, and no async executor
//! between a caller and SQLite. Callers submit closures; the owning
//! thread runs them to completion in arrival order and replies over a
//! oneshot channel.
//!
//! Panic semantics match `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`: a closure that
//! panics propagates its payload to the awaiting caller (the worker
//! thread itself survives and serves the next job). A caller that
//! drops mid-flight simply never observes its result; the job still
//! runs to completion on the worker, so a submitted write is never
//! half-abandoned.
