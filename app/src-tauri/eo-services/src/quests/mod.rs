//! Quest service: the quest and playlist CRUD surface with its shared
//! helper layer (row shaping, cooldown derivation, reward-markup normalisation,
//! mob and playlist-item management), plus the lifecycle actions
//! (start/complete/cancel with ledger and claim integration), the
//! curated session-link suggestions, and the chat-log mission
//! detection (auto-start, auto-complete, and reward suppression),
//! and the analytics readers (per-quest and per-playlist
//! sustainability metrics over curated session links).
//!
//! Payload semantics are an owned contract, pinned by the frozen goldens
//! (ADR-0017): a key that is ABSENT takes the documented default, while a
//! key that is PRESENT binds its value even when null. Truthiness gates
//! (`reward_is_skill`, the mobs list) follow Python falsiness: null,
//! false, zero, and empty strings/arrays/objects all read as false.
//!
//! Row values surface with their stored types (`reward_is_skill` and
//! `is_active` as 0/1 integers, ids as integers); the camelCase wire
//! shaping lives in the facade (`eo-api`), not here.
//!
//! One `QuestService` exists per composition, started with [`start`]
//! (`QuestService::start`): the bus-fed flows (session tracking,
//! mission auto-start) and the watcher's reward-filter calls serialise
//! through a single owning task (see `actor`), while the CRUD, linking,
//! and analytics surfaces are plain `&self` async reads and writes over
//! the shared database handles.
