//! What the quest catalogue can offer the overlay's Activities control
//! right now: a lean projection, deliberately not the enriched CRUD read.
//!
//! The Activities control refreshes on every tracking frame, so this
//! read carries only what a chip needs (identity, the two lifecycle
//! facts, and the instant the availability gate lifts) and skips the
//! per-quest mob round trips the management surface wants.
//! The cooldown arithmetic is the shared [`cooldown_lift`], so an
//! offering can never disagree with the quest row about when a gate
//! lifts.
