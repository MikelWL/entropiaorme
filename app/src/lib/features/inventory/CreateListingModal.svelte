	/**
	 * Sale intake that starts from the game's window rather than from a row.
	 *
	 * The existing sale flow starts by picking a holding, which assumes the
	 * player already knows which tracked position they are selling. In front
	 * of the game's sale window they are reading it off the screen instead, so
	 * this flow runs the other way: record what the window says, resolve which
	 * holding it refers to, then review before anything is written.
	 *
	 * Naming the item is a typeahead over what is actually held, so the usual
	 * case resolves by being chosen rather than by being matched. A name typed
	 * free still resolves on the way out of the field, conservatively: an
	 * ambiguous one is a question put to the player, never a quiet choice of
	 * cost basis, because the wrong holding attributes real money to gameplay
	 * that did not earn it.
	 *
	 * The item comes first and the rest of the form waits on it, because the
	 * item is what makes the rest meaningful: once it is known, a quantity is
	 * enough to say what the sale is worth, since the per-unit TT was recorded
	 * when the stock was looted. The TT field is filled from that and stays
	 * editable, because the game's figure is the authority if they disagree.
	 *
	 * Nothing is complained about until the player tries to file the listing.
	 * A form that opens already scolding the reader for not having filled it
	 * in yet teaches them to ignore its red text.
	 *
	 * The capture buttons are the same flow with the fields filled by reading
	 * the screen instead of by typing. They are inert until that lands, and
	 * marked as such: typing remains a complete path, not a fallback.
