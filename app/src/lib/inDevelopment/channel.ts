 * The channel is stamped at build time by whoever built the app, not inferred
 * from the build mode: an installer built from the latest source is a
 * production Vite build, so build mode cannot distinguish it from a published
 * release. Only the release pipeline sets `STABLE_CHANNEL`, so:
 *
 *   - a published release hides these surfaces, which is what keeps an
 *     unfinished control away from someone who did not build the app;
 *   - a locally built installer, a source build, and the dev server all show
 *     them marked, so the app can be used against what is actually
 *     implemented even where a control is still inert.
